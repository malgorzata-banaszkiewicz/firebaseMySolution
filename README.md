The app is written in React with CSS modules and Firebase showing an imaginary school for unique kids trying to save the world by promoting a vegetarian diet. 
You can register and log in to the page and use the menu bar at the top of the page or go to the main page by navigation placed in the footer area. 
After the login, you will see more positions in the top navigation and a form to add a new student.
Provide the necessary info and check out your new student in the table of pupils below. 
The table provides options to edit the information, delete the pupil, and in the future details about the given person. 
In the comments sections, I have started to add marks given by imaginary teachers and plan to group them by students's IDs. 
In the Grades section, you can see the grades of all the students grouped by the lesson topic. I plan to group this information also by the given student. 
There is also an option to sign out when the work is done. The basic state is a dark mode but I plan to include a switch to light mode as well.
